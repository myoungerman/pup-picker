# pup-picker

Pup Picker is a vanilla JS app that uses the Petfinder API to find dogs that meet your search criteria. If you find a dog you like, you can add it to your favorites. If you change your mind, you can remove that dog from your favorites. My focus was to refresh my JS skills, so the UX is extremely basic.
